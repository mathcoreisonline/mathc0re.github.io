        <p> 
            There is an horror to supporting the claim to be “the most documented person alive” — in any case it would be a despot claim, one that should be met with all suspicion. But we
            are desperate to assign agency to a person whose reality is conquered by consumerist fictions like Sonic The Hedgehog, My Little Pony and the likes. This validates a traumatic lifetime into a collective worldbuilding project derided from the incessant torture of an individual. I’m like almost desperate to sell you my point with anything Guy Debord said about the spectacle, I’ll fraudulently try with my worst possible pitch, to paraphrase.
            “It is not a mere decoration added to the real world. It is the very heart of this real society’s unreality” and “The spectacle is able to subject human beings to itself because the economy has already totally subjugated them”
            when he wrote that, print media was the norm but on the internet age we know we’re curating and perverting the relations of people through images in far more effective ways than printed media could have ever hoped to. The gossip industry has now become less of an industry and more of a democratic process where the demons of the community are continually castrated and punished for a schizophrenic tabloid that reflects not the act but ritual of the spectacle in the internet age. This is the centerpiece of what the Lolcow is! They are the modern day rock stars, anti-pop icons castrated from their agency much like their audience is.
            Now, Are you a demiurge or spreading its myth?
        </p>
        <p>  
            Take the A-log for example. In the communities that follow the lolcow it is a figure based on an actual person who would scrutinize the moral aspects of chris chan as a person rather than a character. The a-log was quite literally preaching to the choir, it makes a compelling case why the scrutiny of the lolcow is indirect. The medium and nature of it is a breeding ground for impotence and parasocial agency, It is a losing battle and acknowledging it doesn’t do the spectacle much favors, it sours the enjoyment. You wouldn’t tell Marion Crane she’s about to be murdered on the shower. If you could you would deprive the world of cinema from such an iconic scene, but now that you know you can… Well. Go figure how uncomfortable it is to acknowledge impotence in a work of fiction. 
        </p>     
        <p>  
        In the case of Chris Chan, as the harbinger of this epoch they are not a living person. They don’t age because their life is told in sagas, chapters. They don’t have a life, they’re making “Christory” [sic]. Friends, family and incidental bystanders become characters that require lore to comprehend, this reminds me of what David Foster Wallace refers to as an author’s predatory glare, like a hawk waiting to strike is prey in the mundane. and yet for as much as their trolls brand themselves as voyeurs, it requires hypocrisies in order to be. The CWCki, a site dedicated to this collective worldbuilding project, begs the reader to observe and not make Christory, yet in practice It requires for Chris to be fucked with in order to observed in the first place. It requires an act of violence, Jon Rafman was eager to make a similar observation when talking about his work “Kool Aid Man In Second Life”, where he would document the sim and its users as proof that the kitsch and the fine arts are useless dichotomies in the internet age like some sort of digital safari. Rafman’s work is not the most interesting thing ever if you’ve even know what a lolcow is, it’s fucking boring nowadays, but it has a lot in common with the spectacle of it. It has more in common with a 2010s cringe compilation than with an anthropological document, but his reflection draws a more empathetic version of what lolcow culture would be.
        </p>
        <p>    
            we have arrogantly outgrown the need for anthropomorphism like that in Aesop’s fables in order to tell a lesson. He’s a relic of a bygone era. The spectacle is at its most intense element when we dehumanize. endlessly. For days, months, years on end. only then It’s a tried-and-true lesson for life. 
        </p>     
        <p>  
            Prior to being arrested, Chris had little to no acknowledgement in legacy media like tv, newspapers or literature other than bits and pieces where they’re not part of its narrative like a digital cryptid breaching containment. Fools, they are. They were desperate to sell me the idea Kim K. could “break the internet” and it broke her ex-husband a couple of years later, Though I digress. Legacy media claims chris a youtuber or influencer because they cannot comprehend *why* the lolcow is. They want to assign these neo-rockstars agency in what is essentially no man’s land.
            The stars are dead. the rockstars of today live until a talent agency gets a hold of them, you don’t die at 27, fame these days doesn’t come with unfathomable riches and laughing in the face of god, but endless scrutiny that the riches don’t justify unless you’re a Taylor or Drake.
            In times of turmoil, you’re not prince walking on stage with SLAVE written on your cheek and neither can the rock stars of today. But they can now black out their profile picture to communicate turmoil just like you. you leave a digital footprint to be scrutinized for days on end, it is tabloid at its most schizophrenic because now you don’t need to be at the crossfire of mainstream media to be fucked with by the collective and none with the romance or swagger. They are just as online as you are. They have to uninstall social media sometimes because they’re a little too online. 
            The Lolcow’s name and tales are curses unto themselves. “You don’t want to know” is a general sentiment and there is humor in running for cover. It’s almost like an initiation ritual. You’re not learning about Chris, Cyraxx, Nick Bate, Pamperchu, Purplekecleon, Puppychan - You name it. You’re submitted into their worlds because they are worlds you can live vicariously through unlike, say, For me, the stage where Billie Eilish is singing to an eager audience.
            We can scrutinize Cobain’s career if he did not commit suicide, If Buddy Holly or Aaliyah didn’t board those planes for years on end, but that’s because they’re less of folklore and moreso myth. But the lolcow is folklore, and the most ardent followers of this phenomenon vanquish their agency into what-ifs not unlike those of youths bonding with boy bands, actresses or rock stars.
        </p>
        <p>      
            I believe a prototype of the lolcow as we know it today can be found in the 90’s black metal scene, right in the heart of gen x’s campy rejection of consumerism, mostly for aesthetic reasons, the croons of a scene formed by disaffected youths become anthems, in a world Where Ozzy biting the head off a bat wasn’t enough, where we already knew the cops were not breaking into an ac/dc concert and RUN DMC made a song with none other than the fuckups from Aerosmith, and camp is what they got in return. They got the true misanthropes, and finally.
            The black metal heavyweights were mostly still in their late teens or early 20’s by the point it was all an exciting myth.
            all of the church burnings and bizarre Antics accounting musicians cutting themselves on stage, smelling the carcasses of dead animals and their infatuation with the idea of “spreading evil, terror and darkness” were instrumental in tapping into the imaginations of people at that time now that the mainstream turned out to be phonies playing by the scrutiny of an industry all along, Even Marilyn manson, the public enemy of #1 of the time had to declare rock was dead and satirized himself at the height of his career with a record like Mechanical Animals, Columbine had not even happened yet, Now similarily a lot of Japanese Noise and metal acts were infamous for their shock, but the black metal scene as a western phenomenon still rings more resonant because it’s all tales with endings more tragic and intense than overdoses and passionate crimes. They were all nerdy kids infatuated with escapist promises found in their interests for the occult, paganism and tabletop RPGs. They were not the coked up sellouts in LA, they were the disaffected, they could have been the kids you have added on steam, talking about returning to tradition and finding christ on kiwifarms, but like I said. You and your friends on the puter are modern day rockstars. You didn’t even stand a chance. Yngve Ohlim(Ingwa) Dead, the vocalist of mayhem commited suicide at merely 22 years of age and his corpse was commodified into the canon of his band quite literally, He died just one year older than post-punk legend Ian Curtis Euronymous was murdered just one year older than me, at 25 and varg vikernes has become perversely infatuated by his syncretic white nationalist myth mixed with his obsession with tabletop RPGs, the What if Maria Orsic lived in the works of Tolkien. I said they are the prototype because they were the odd in the mundane, I believe that had the internet been the behemoth it is today at that time, it would have been easier to dismantle the myth, to realize the feared misanthropes are actually just very, very troubled disaffected youths who believe in their hype to a religious extent.

         <h2>Kiwifarms as of november 2024.</p>
        <p>
        speaking about Kiwifarms or imageboards in anything other than hush tones is thought to be a sentence of sorts and for good reason, You’ve opened pandora’s box. It’s on you cause its renowned reputation is no accident. It originally was the CWCki forums, and now for gossip forum of its scale it’s only natural it would attract such scrutiny by mainstream media by simply going against popular narratives. It’s probably the last standing, culturally relevant gossip forum of the day that isn’t pertinent to mainstream social media. I mean, When Kiwifarms was temporarily taken down by Cloudflare, plenty of terminally online netizens celebrated its apparent demise as a plate of justice served cold. But that’s because Kiwifarms was left to thaw. Take the case of Purplekecleon and their troupe of enablers. They’re a furry artist with a larger platform and cult than any of the victims who have come forward denouncing their abuse over the years. You know bad guys and they don’t lend a helping hand, right? This is why taking down Kiwifarms pretty much takes down the case against it, the devil was in the details and cloudflare scrubbed them clean from the canvas and if we’re accounting the site’s body count of a few suicides, Facebook has had a mass shooting, plenty of cartel and gang violence, livestreamed murders and pushing all sorts of dangerous ideologies and panics throughout its hands free algorithmic moderation. That’s far more damning than pushing. Fuck. Cloudflare just made a case for kiwifarms. chastise it all you want. Maybe It’s transphobic, racist, sexist, misogynistic, misandrist, ableist… And yet none of that matters in the way you think it does, it’s the selling point. That’s why it’s “cool”. Now, I personally don’t believe engaging with this type of pathos that castrates you from agency is cool especially as I grow older, but I cannot frame it in other way than being just the internet’s middle finger to what you thought was sacred. 
            
        When we shistpost We are the adolescent minds In our hearts, We are pop icons on set, but one wrong step and we’re the scapegoats. suffering is romantic because we can feel pain in advance and gauge it. We know the answer and knowing it is more comforting as is crafting a fiction around the question.
