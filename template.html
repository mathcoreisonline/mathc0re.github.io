                    As we speak I am contacting my
                    secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for
                    the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking
                    dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just
                    with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire
                    arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable
                    ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution
                    your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking
                    tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit
                    fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo
